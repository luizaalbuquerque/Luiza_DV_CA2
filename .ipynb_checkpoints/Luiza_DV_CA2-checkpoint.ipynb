    "Graphs are non-linear Data Structures which are great for representing relationships, while Trees are non-linear Data Structures, they are great for representing hierarchy and are often used for sorted data. <b> Regarding connections: </b> In a graph, there are no strict rules about relationships between nodes. In a tree, each node (not taking into consideration the root node) has exacly one parent.</br> <b>Example: </b> Considering a social network as an example, <b>regarding a graph:</b> Nodes will be represented by each person and edges the connections betwen those people. Such as: Luiza, Ivan, Gabriel and Leticia are nodes and the edges are: Luiza is friends with Ivan and Gabriel, Ivan is friends with Gabriel, Gabriel follows Leticia, and Leticia and Luiza are not directly connected.  <b>regarding a Tree:</b> Considering the same connections but different organization, Imagine Luiza as the root node and connections forming a hierarchical structure. With that is possible follow the tree rules and paths from the root to any node, connected downwards in a structured manner. Making a single path from the root to any node, and each node (except the root) has exactly one parent. \n",

Finding the shortest route between two cities as an example. Basically, graphs do that by dividing the problem into a set of connected nodes, being each node a vertex and each of the connections an edge. Graphs abstration is good because allows to only focus on the essential elements of the problem to find an optimal solution. \n",
